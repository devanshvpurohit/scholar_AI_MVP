    "Actively engage with the problem-solving questions. Try to sketch out solutions or algorithms before reading the detailed explanations.",
    "For complex topics like Backpropagation and SVMs, break them down into smaller, manageable steps.",
    "Use visualization tools to understand concepts like decision boundaries, principal components, and clustering.",
    "When encountering formulas, try to derive them or understand the derivation process rather than just memorizing.",
    "Formulate your own questions based on the material to test your understanding.",
    "Collaborate with peers if possible, discussing challenging topics can lead to deeper insights.",
    "Review past mistakes in problem-solving to avoid repeating them."

  "flash_cards": [
    [
      "What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for prediction or classification, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns or structures."
    ],
    [
      "What is the purpose of an activation function in an MLP?",
      "Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing MLPs to learn complex patterns that linear models cannot."
    ],
    [
      "What does PCA aim to achieve?",
      "PCA aims to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming features into a new set of uncorrelated components (principal components) that capture the maximum variance."
    ],
    [
      "What is the primary goal of Support Vector Machines (SVMs)?",
      "SVMs aim to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin."
    ],
    [
      "What is the 'curse of dimensionality'?",
      "The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces, which do not occur in low-dimensional settings. This can lead to increased computational cost and reduced model performance."
    ],
    [
      "What is the role of a loss function in MLP training?",
      "The loss function quantifies the error between the predicted output and the actual target, guiding the backpropagation algorithm to adjust weights and minimize this error."
    ],
    [
      "What is the main difference between bagging and boosting?",
      "Bagging (e.g., Random Forest) builds multiple models independently on bootstrap samples of the data and averages their predictions. Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost) builds models sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors of the previous ones."
